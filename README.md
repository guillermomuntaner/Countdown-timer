# Countdown Timer

![Workflow result](https://github.com/guillermomuntaner/Countdown-timer/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
An interactive countdown timer.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
When I read about the challenge I immediately thought of this [nice clock compose animation demo](https://twitter.com/_aurimas/status/1366557927067185157?s=20)
 from [@_aurimas](https://twitter.com/_aurimas) that I saw just a couple of days ago. I decided to go
 with this design but make it fully interactive so users can easily drag to set the timer.
